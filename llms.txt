# Ralli

Ralli is a real-time scavenger hunt platform for event organizers. Participants join games, navigate to GPS waypoints, submit photo proof, and compete on live leaderboards.

## Architecture
- Frontend: React 19 + Vite (PWA-optimized)
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Realtime + Auth)
- Maps: Leaflet with OpenStreetMap
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Linting: Biome (replaces ESLint+Prettier)

## File Structure
- src/components/    - React components
- src/pages/         - Route pages
- src/hooks/         - Custom React hooks
- src/lib/           - Supabase client, utilities
- supabase/          - Database migrations, RLS policies

## Key Decisions
- PWA for "app-like" mobile experience without app store
- Row-Level Security for multi-tenant game isolation
- Real-time subscriptions for live leaderboard updates

## How to Extend
1. Add new waypoint types in src/components/Waypoint/
2. Modify scoring logic in src/hooks/useScoring.ts
3. Database changes go in supabase/migrations/
